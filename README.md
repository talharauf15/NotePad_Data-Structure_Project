# NotePad_Data-Structure_Project
The Console Notepad project is a collaborative effort between Talha Rauf and Danish Aziz, aiming to create a minimalist yet powerful console-based application for note-taking.


Key Features:

Text Storage using Linked Lists:
Utilizing linked lists, the application efficiently manages the storage and retrieval of textual data. Each node in the linked list represents a line of text, providing dynamic and scalable storage.

Basic Text Editing Operations:
Implementing standard text editing operations such as insertion, deletion, and modification, the console notepad ensures a user-friendly experience for creating and editing notes.

Search and Replace Functionality:
Incorporating search and replace algorithms, users can quickly locate specific words or phrases within their notes and replace them as needed. This enhances the usability of the application for users dealing with extensive textual content.

Command-Line Interface (CLI):
The application boasts an intuitive command-line interface, allowing users to interact with the notepad using text-based commands. This enhances accessibility and provides a seamless user experience for those comfortable with command-line environments.

File I/O Operations:
To ensure data persistence, the console notepad supports file input/output operations. Users can save their notes to external files and load them back into the application for continued editing.

Technologies Used:

C++ Programming Language:
The project is implemented using C++, harnessing its versatility and performance for efficient data manipulation.

Linked Lists:
Linked lists are employed for dynamic storage and manipulation of text data, enabling seamless editing and navigation.

File Handling:
File handling operations are implemented to save and load notes, providing users with the ability to persist their data beyond a single session.

Future Enhancements:
The project lays the foundation for potential future enhancements, including the integration of more advanced data structures, improved search algorithms, and the introduction of additional text formatting features.

This Console Notepad project showcases the practical application of fundamental data structures in creating a functional and accessible text-editing tool in a console environment.
